# Project_Malala

Created a dynamic website by using  CSS/HTML/PHP following the tutorials from Abdul Wali on Youtube. Feel free to use it, however, just remember I am not reponsible for any damges that my occur from the use of my scripts!


To run the script!

Edit config.php file and change the USER and PASS to your PhpMyAdmin login details.
Install the MALALA.SQL database in your database.

The login details for the Administraion Page:

Username:  admin
Password:  admin

If you done all fine then the website should be working without problems.
